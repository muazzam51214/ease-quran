                <p>Welcome to the Al Huda Ease Quran Academy, a place dedicated to embracing and disseminating the beauty and knowledge of the Quran with a community of searchers and believers on a global scale. I'm excited to introduce myself and tell the history of our academy as the founder and inspiration behind this project.</p>

                <h2 className='heading' id='about-heading'>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My name is Ahmad Sulaiman, and I first encountered the Quran when I was very young. I was exposed to the verses, recitations, and teachings of the Quran from a young age because I grew up in a family wholly committed to the principles of Islam. But it wasn't until I was a teenager that I really started to understand how powerful an influence the Quran could have on a person's life.</p>
